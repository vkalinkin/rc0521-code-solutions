          <p>
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from
            both critics and players, with some critics calling it the
            best installment in the series. It received praise for its
            large amount of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash
            gameplay elements, although its online mode was widely
            criticized.
