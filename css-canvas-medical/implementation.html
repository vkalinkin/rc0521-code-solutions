            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that we far outperform other vendors and
            offer an unmatched return
            on investment. Out goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one way of the
            other. We will provide access
            to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current
            customers to talk about their experience.

            Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community resources. At a minimum, this means proting over your fax number,
            enrolling your payers with our clearinghourse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred specialists and imaging
            centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information
            technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

            The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data. which we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
            databases. Then our work begins to improt into Canvas. Pateient demographics and information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
            While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

            We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live
            to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work
            side-by-side with you on implementation and training.

            Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be with you, either in person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure everything
            goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations,
            modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

            All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if wee are not meeting
            expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee:
            if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive
            partnership for us both.
